I was the kid who could master complex video games in days but struggled to pass basic math. I can back this up, in my elementary to high school education, I was always the "dumb" kid in class. I was always the kid that was getting bullied for not knowing something. and my grades reflect that. across all subject i've only got Minimum Competency Standards or around 60-70% for most of my subjects.

This effect my belief that i'm not good at learning, and i'm not good at learning new things. but until one day i read about podomoro technique in high school, and it change grade significantly. firstly i just do 2-4x podomoro a day for months. when i got my grade report, i got above 85% in all of my subject.

This moment was a turning point in my life. I began to delve deeper into self-learning, exploring various techniques to find what worked best for me. Interestingly, I excelled at video games like CS:GO, Dota 2 and other video games, mastering game mechanics and strategies quickly. Yet, learning school subjects was a different challenge until I found the Pomodoro technique. It transformed my learning skills, enabling me to tackle any subject with confidence.


# Building a Strong Foundation

also i've notice when i start my study journey, i dont understand why i'm not able to understand the material at all. i start search internet what is that case and i found out is Prerequisite skill problem. because i never learn about anything related to that subject before. my brain just cant found the connection between the subject. It't same like trying defeat a Elden boss at level 1. is not impossible, but is damn hard.

after realize that, i start learn prerequisite skill before start learning the actual material. such as learning basic math before learning calculus, learning basic physics before learning quantum physics. i'm sure it demoralizing when you knowing will relearning the material you should learn before. it going take more time, and make you feel like you're not progressing. but trust me it worth it and it create a strong foundation. like in video game, you need to farming and grinding to get stronger to beat the boss at the end of the game.


# Have a achieve my goal?

I can't say that i'm an expert in learning, but i'm confident that i'm better than most people at learning. i'm confident that i can learn anything i want with a good guide and enough time. most of my goal is achieve with this method. but some skill it take long live to learn like language or coding. but i'm sure that with enough time everyone can learn anything they want. like my grade in college are the highest among my friend. and i can learn multiple domain like web development, android development, game development, and now backend developmet and devops.

# What next? 

I want to create a guide and resource to help people learn anything they want. i want to create a community of people who are learning and help each other. i want to create a place where people can learn anything they want with a good guide and enough time. so why i start making this blog i hope i can contribute to other and make grater impact on people live. maybe in the future i will create a youtube channel to make it more engaging and reach more people.

# Final words

Ok, i think i say too much. so the main thing to takeaway is

- Find a way to make learning as fun as playing video game
- Get a good night sleep
- Eat a healthy diet
- Exercise regularly
